## Features

1. Randomly generates ship positions for each game iteration
2. Simulates computer-based attacks until all ships are destroyed
3. Calculates the average time taken to complete a given number of games

## Getting Started
# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x

# Running the Simulation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/battleship-game-simulation.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd battleship-game-simulation

3. Run the main.py script:
python main.py

4. Enter the number of times the simulation should run when prompted:
Please enter the how many times the game should run: 1000 (or more)

5. The script will run the simulation for the specified number of times and display the average time taken to complete the games.
